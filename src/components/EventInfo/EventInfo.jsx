            Covid safety protocols will be in place at the in-person edition of McHacks in order
            to protect the safety of everyone at our event. These include vaccine passport checks
            at sign-in, limited capacity, social distancing, and mask-wearing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whichever way you choose to attend, you'll get the full McHacks experience of innovation, networking, and workshops.
